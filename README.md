# Logo Generator App

## Description

This Logo Generator is a command-line Node.js application that enables users to create simple logos with customizable text, colors, and shapes. It's designed for freelance web developers who need quick, basic logos for their projects without the need for extensive graphic design. Users can select from a variety of shapes (circle, triangle, square), set colors for both text and shape, and input a short text (up to three characters) to be displayed on the logo. The output is an SVG file that can be used in web projects or further edited in graphic design software.
